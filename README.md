This is my final year project where I am tasked to design a fitness web application for novices in strength training.

## Usage
My application is powered by Heroku with the link: https://infinite-dusk-38197-7c32c3198e7a.herokuapp.com/

Because I don't want to incur any unnecessary charges for my hosting of the web application, please request access.
